Steps 
1- create vpc
- Enable DNS hostname = memorable hostname instead of IP address for our resoucres
2- Create internet gateway and attcahed to vpc
- igw : enable resources in the vpc to have access to internet.
3- creation of subnets : Enable logically grouping of resources bas on their needs
 - Public subnet resources = load balance, nat gateway. (Auto assign IP address enable)
 - Private Subnet resources = EC2 instance, RDS instance.
4- Public subnets Route table createable 
- Public RT is a resource that has a route to the internet and when associate with any subnet will be public.
- Add public route (destination = 0.0.0.0/0, target = igw)
- associate the Public RT with the twoo pulic subnets
- Note AWS automatically create default route table cal  when you create a vpc
- subnets not been explicitly associated with any route tables and are therefore associated with the main route table:
5- NAT Gateway : Allows resources in the private subnets to have access to the internet and 
 - prevent users from the internet to have access to the resoucres in the private subnets.
6- Private Subnet Route Table : Enable resources in the private subnets to have access to the internet via the nat gateway.
 - associate the Private RT with the private subnets.
 - What is the diff btw public subnets and private subnet.
 = Private subnets have a route table that route traffic to the internet via the nat gateway
 = Public subnets have a route table that route traffic to the interenet via the interenet gateway
7 - Security Group : act as fire wall use to regulate network traffic in the vpc.
- Application load balancer - SG :
- EICE-SG
- App server SG
8 - Create EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint : Allows you to connect to any resources in the private or public subnet with having to manage the 
 - without managing the ssh keys.
9 - Create a target group
10 - CReate EC2 instance
- Add the EC2 instance into the target group
11 - create Alb 
12- Create new new record in route 53
13 Request an SSL certificate
14 Setup HTTPS listener fo the Application load balancer.
